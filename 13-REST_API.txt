REST API: how to build your own restful api
	
	robomongo.org - Robo3T a GUI for MongoDB
	Postman
	
	REST: REpresentational State Transfer
		it's essentially just an architectural style for designing API
		other architectural style: SOAP, GraphQL, Falcor
	2 most important rules:
		Use HTTP Request Verbs : like GET, POST, PUT-PATCH, DELETE
		Use specific pattern of Routes/Endpoints URLs :
			/all_item_route :
				GET: will fetches all item
				POST: will create only one item
				DELETE: will delete all item
			/all_item_route/one_specific_item :
				GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE: they, all will be apply to the specific item
	

	GET /all_item_route
	POST /all_item_route : in order to create a new item
		Postman is really useful here, because he allows to send data without building a front-end
		
	app.route("route")
	.get(function(req, res){})
	.post(callback)
	.delete(callback)
	.put(callback)
	.patch(callback)
