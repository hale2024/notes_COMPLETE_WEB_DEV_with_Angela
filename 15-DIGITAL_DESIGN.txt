DESIGN SCHOOL / DIGITAL DESIGN : In design, the golden rule is function comes before form in all cases
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COLOUR:
	Colour Theory:
		Pick a color palette accordingly the mood that you want to convey:
		RED: Love, Energy, Intensity
		YELLOW: Joy, Intellect, 'Attention'
		GREEN: Freshness, Safety, Growth
		BLUE: Stability, Trust, Serenity
		PURPLE: Royalty, Feminity, Wealth
	
	Tools for Designing with Colours:
		ColorHunt.com
		FlatUIColors.com //well configured for iOS apps
		MaterialPalette.com //well configured for android apps
		ColorZilla //chrome&firefox extension to pick hex of color that you find well on other website
	
	Combining colours to create Color Palettes:
		Monocromatic Colours: 
			tend to be incredibly contemporary and work really well for modern design so it's very in vogue actually
			
			/so taking the same colour and combining it either with various amounts of black or white,
			to create different tone and shades that stand out from each other/
			
		Analogous Colours: adjacent colors
			plesant to look at for a long time
			so good for app background screen, app main interface 
			
		Complementary Colours: opposed colors in the color wheel
			produce extremely flashy design, that greatly grab attention
			so good for logo, app screenshots
			
		Split Colours: instead of taking the opposite color, you will take the adjacent color of a color
			best for app icon, because, it grab attention but it's not too bad flashy
		
		Triadic Colours: pick a color and then draw an equilateral triangle at the opposite
			mostly use in the 90s

TYPOGRAPHY: yes FONTS MATTER
	Two typeface/font family: serif / sans-serif
	
	SERIF: useful for classic/old styles
		have this tiny little feet at the endpoint of the letter
		4 families:
			Old Style: Adobe Jenson is an old style serif typeface
			Transitional: Baskerville
			Modern: Didot
			Slab-Serif: American Typewriter
			
	SANS-SERIF: for modern styles
		4 families:
			Grotesque: News Gothic
			Neo-Grotesque:  Helvetica, Ariel
			Humanist: Gill Sans
			Geometric: Futura
	
	Typography Determines Readability:
		we can compare their open shapes, intercharacter space, ambiguous/not forms, varying proportions
		
	DESIGN WITH ONLY FORM AND NO FUNCTION WILL NEVER EVER WORK WELL
	
    How to combine fonts like a pro:
	Advices/Best practices:
		Mix Serif & Sans-Serif: serif is good at header and sans-serif in body, but the vice-versa is good to
		Don't mix serif with serif / sans-serif with sans-serif
		
		Too many fonts is not a good thing, 2 different fonts is enough
		Don't mix different moods, Go for similar moods
		
	Resume of advice/best practices:
		What must be similar: the Mood(like with colors) & the Era(modern with modern, classic with classic)
		What must be contrast: 
			the Serif-ness: i.e mix Serif with Sans-serif and vice versa. 
							but never mix serif with serif or sans-serif with sans-serif
			
			the Weights: so it's good to combine different weight to increase the readability
			
			
	The six fonts to never EVER use: ComicSans, Papyrus, Kristen, Viner, Curlz, (Euuboa-grec_letter)
		because they will pretty much never ever look good in design
			
	THE TOOLS:
		WhatFont: a chrome extension to grab infos about fonts in an website
		FontSquirrel.com
		fonts.google.com
		SkyFonts: a macOS application

USER INTERFACE(UI) DESIGN:
	1. If an app was a journey:
		so, as a designer, you must guide your user 
		don't display information in one homogene block of text,
		but guide them to the big title, then subtitle, and then image block, text...
		
	2. How to pretend to have a designer:
		Alignment: 
		  a fundemental principle of graphical design is to try to minimize the number of alignment lines
		  2 fundamental types:
			Edge Alignment: most use
				you have all the elements having one side lining up with a single line
			Center Alignment
			
	3. How to get more clickthrough
		The light must always come from above
		Flat vs Material Design: material is best, it's follow most the purpose of 'design'
		
	4. How to design if you know nothing about design	
		Keep things as simple as you can to start with : this is also valable for programming, starting a business
		
		When creating a website/an app, start with a monochrome design just black and white or hints of gray
		that way, you can focus on the layout, on the alignment, on making things look good
		so start in monochrome and then give a single shot of color, to highlight the key thing that you want grab user's attention to it 
		then maybe add two color or three
		
		take inspiration to: dribble.com //use the hex color search  
		
	5. MAKE TEXT VISIBLE ON IMAGES
		image -> then inside create a block -> then put text in the block
			so play with the opacity, the background-color of the block
			
		if the image is never going to change, then play with the color of text, background-color of the image
	
		/if the image will change, just add a single blank overlay(block), with 20% opacity,
		so the text will be readable with any background image/
		
		/the most clever way is to apply an overlay that start off at 0% opacity at the center midline of the screen,
		then as we move downwards through the image, there is a graded opacity, so the overlay get more and more opaque
		so we can go to 0% in the middle, to 20% opacity at the bottom of the screen/
		
	6. How to become an attention architect(wizard)
		use the previous techniques such as playing with fonts to grap attention, to become a good ui architect
